# D3-Choropleth-Map-USA

### Section 1 - Overview 
- This is a website that focuses on a using D3 to demonstrate the unemployement rate in the US with data taken from an excel .tsv file.


### Section 2 - Purpose 
- The main purpose of this project is for multiple applications. 
- This knowledge will be used in creating React Apps further down the road. Ideally I would like to make it more dynamic
  for the user using state as a tool.
- I learned how to do this so I could eventually later down the road, build a Three-Dimensional version of this. 


### Section 3 - Directions
- The user does not need to do anything. This data visualization is purely static.


### Section 4 - Notes 
- This component was made to be reused in React for clients to save time.


### Section 5 - Summary 
- This was fun to put together and enjoyed it greatly!
